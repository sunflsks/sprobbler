# Spotify Sprobbler

## just a leraning experiment for psql and flask among other things

## The ultimate goal of this project it to be a functional last.fm clone, except instead of a website interface it delivers the information through SwiftUI (because I don't know how to make a website yet LOL)

## TODO:
- Paginate Recent Tracks
    - Right now, only Top 10 tracks are shown. Have option to paginate as well
- Show top 5 most listened-to artists in the past week
- Show top 5 most listened-to artists in the past month

- Show top 5 most listened-to albums in the past week
- Show top 5 most listened-to albums in the past month

- Create a "Top Track" algorithm and display said "Top Track" to the user
- Create daily/weekly/montly reports
    - Each report has
        - Number of artists listened to
        - Number of albums listened to
        - Number of tracks listened to

        - Top 5 Tracks
        - Top 5 Albums
        - Top 5 Artists

        - "Listening Clock"
            - A feature that shows a "clock", with each hour proportionally filled out by the amount of listening in that hour compared to the rest

        - Scrobbles per day
        - Listening time
        - How many scrobbles in most active day
