# Spotify Sprobbler

## The ultimate goal of this project it to be a functional last.fm clone, except instead of a website interface it delivers the information through SwiftUI

## TODO

- Create a "Top Track" algorithm and display said "Top Track" to the user
- Create daily/weekly/montly reports
    - Each report has
        - "Listening Clock"
            - A feature that shows a "clock", with each hour proportionally filled out by the amount of listening in that hour compared to the rest
